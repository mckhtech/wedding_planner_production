RISK,Gmail OAuth Complexity - Week 3,High severity. Start early with Google OAuth Playground testing. Use test account for development. Mock OAuth flow temporarily if needed.,"Mitigation: Early start, thorough testing
Contingency: Use mock for frontend development"
RISK,AI Costs Exceed Budget - Week 6-8,High severity. Implement aggressive caching from day 1. Rate limiting (10 requests/min/user). Monitor costs daily.,"Mitigation: Caching + rate limits + monitoring
Contingency: Reduce AI features or use gpt-3.5-turbo"
RISK,Email Sync Performance - Week 4,High severity. Use Celery workers with batch processing. Optimize queries with select_related/prefetch_related.,"Mitigation: Celery + query optimization
Contingency: Limit sync to last 30 days initially"
RISK,Outlook Integration Issues - Week 11,Medium severity. Test Microsoft Graph API thoroughly in Week 10 before full integration.,"Mitigation: Early testing in Week 10
Contingency: Launch with Gmail only, add Outlook post-launch"
RISK,Frontend-Backend API Misalignment - Week 4+,Medium severity. Daily standups to review API contracts. Frontend uses mock data until backend ready.,"Mitigation: Daily API contract reviews
Contingency: Frontend mocks APIs, integrates in batches"
RISK,AWS Deployment Delays - Week 12,Medium severity. Start AWS EC2 setup in Week 10, not Week 12.,"Mitigation: Start deployment prep early
Contingency: Use Heroku/Render for quick deployment"
RISK,Scope Creep - All Weeks,High severity. Lock MVP scope in Week 1 document. Create Phase 2 backlog for all new requests. Say NO to new features.,"Mitigation: Locked scope + Phase 2 backlog
Contingency: Prioritize ruthlessly based on user value"
RISK,Team Member Unavailability - Any Week,Medium severity. Document all work clearly. Maintain up-to-date README files. Cross-train team members.,"Mitigation: Clear documentation + cross-training
Contingency: Team members can cover for each other"
